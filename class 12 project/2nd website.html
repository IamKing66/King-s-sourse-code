    <p>Established on 2nd May 1959 under the administrative control of the Council of Scientific & Industrial
         Research (CSIR), Birla Industrial & Technological Museum in Kolkata is widely regarded as the mother of
          science museum movement in India. The idea behind this pioneering initiative came from Dr. B C Roy, the
        then Chief Minister of West Bengal who after visiting the Deutsches Museum in Munich was inspired to create
         a similar institution in India for public engagement with science & technology. His vision and efforts in
          this regard found instant support and patronage from the likes of Pandit Jawharlal Nehru, the then Prime
         Minister of India, and industrialist Shri G D Birla.The latter donated the Birla Park, his sprawling
         bungalow and the adjoining plot of land in the upscale Ballygunge area of Calcutta, to CSIR for setting up
          an Industrial and Technological Museum. Pandit Nehru received this magnanimous gift from Shri G D Birla in
         1956.
        Starting with the taking over of the Birla Park in 1956 by the Govt. of India to the Museum’s inauguration in 
        1959, the journey was quite eventful and challenging. Careful planning and painstaking efforts by the museum’s
         planning committee that was headed by Dr. B C Roy himself and included a host of renowned scientists, educationists
          and industrialists ultimately resulted in the formation of India’s first science museum under the ambit of the central government</p>
