         I usually prefer a simple life but however my day ends with and new
         life lessons. Few days before i was sitting in my room relaxly but
         sudden my phone rang,<br>
         my friend Roshan was calling me. when i picked up he sayed lets make a
         plan for tour after exams. So we final that we will go to my village,
         it is situated in U.P, Balli, Basdih uttar tola.<br>
         So, two tickets for window seat were also booked for 24.May.2024 but my
         at the end momemt my friend's gandpa died in an accident.So, i final
         that will go. I was travelling through Shealdah to Ballia express.<br>
         That day sky was clear but when the train suddendly it started raining.
         A smell of soil spreded every where in eviorment. At Titanagar a girl
         boarded the train<br>
         , her parent were came to saw her off the train was almost empty as it
         was sleeper coach. As my friend canceled his ticket the seat was
         alloted to her. She was fair and tall.<br>
         I asked her " Are you going all the way Ballia" she was puzzled for a
         momemt and said
         "yes, i am going to ballia to visit her grandma's house for holidays".
         <br>
         she asked me the same question and i replied the same answer. she had a
         cleer ringing voice, like an mountain stream. For a while we sat quite
         but at approx 1:34 pm.<br>
         she opened her tiffin and offered me her lunch. In my mind ; my mother
         had sayed never take food from stangers but still i picked up one puri
         and aloodum it was still raining outside.<br>
         i asked her who made this she sayed she herself cooked her lunch.

         I replied her your beautifull and skilled, as i expected she can't
         resist flattery and blushed. in small time we become friends. at night
         we both don't have sllep in our eyes.<br>
         whole night we talked about our hobby,colleege,relationship,house and
         village. Next day i woke up at 8:00 am before our station i also woke
         her up. After departure from the train we both sat on same rikshaw <br>
         because our destination was same. After some time we were at our
         village but her house was about 4 km from my house we said good byes at
         the end but i forgot to ask her name and number but it was too late.<br>
